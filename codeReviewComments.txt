Code Review Comments:

1)We should not use Thread.sleep, it is very bad practise.
This will makes program hangs for sometime. Instead we should use explicit wait.

2)Methods which are common to all classes like test initialize, test clean up, etc. we should
have in base class and extends in every test class. (Inheritance).
