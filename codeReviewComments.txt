Code Review Comments:

1)We should not use Thread.sleep, it is very bad practise.
This will makes program hangs for sometime. Instead we should use explicit wait.

2)Methods which are common to all classes like test initialize, test clean up, etc. we should
have in base class and extends in every test class. (Inheritance).

3)Project structure should be proper like according to maven standard. For example

src/main -> should contains common classes like common functions which are common throughout the application

src/test -> should contains test classes which contains test methods.

4)There should be properties file which contains information at project level like
application url, etc. Like I have implemented testsettings.properties file.

5)There should be test ng file so that we can run via maven commands, also we can get other
benefits of testng file.

6)There should be result reporting like extent reports.

7)There should not be hard coded values in test scripts like in flights test Bangalore, Delhi,etc
are hard coded. It should be comes from testdata file.

8)We should use page object model else a single ui change would need a lot of changes at a lot of places.

etc...
